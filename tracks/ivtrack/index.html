            Innovation challenge SS12 is an international project competition
            and maker fair established by IEEE Srilanka Section and IEEE
            Education Society to acknowledge innovative minds that address
            social issues across the globe with ingenious solutions. This
            exceptional platform conducts competition in two stages. The
            preliminary stage is conducted across Asian countries and the team
            that tops the round wins a chance to compete globally to address
            social issues like Poverty, Famine, Disaster Management and First
            Aid, Special Needs, Women Safety, Healthcare or Literacy with the
            assistance of inventive technologies. All Engineering graduates and
            professionals have a visionary to make their ideas come true.
            Unfortunately, the monotonicity of our daily life catches up with us
            and we look track of our high aspirations and goals are lost in the
            sea of realism. Bland repetitive work causes the mind to stagnate
            bringing brain drain into prominence. Here SS12 acts as a platform
            to bridge the gap between the Engineers and their Visionary to
            contribute to the society with innovations. It aids in stimulating
            their Inherent Potential to pave way for the invention.

                  course of choice for the last few years, with a strict focus
                  on Software Engineering and Data Analysis which has provided
                  me various career opportunities. In addition to studies and
                  private work, I enjoy watching movies, playing football and
                  socialising with new and interesting people. Having spent the
                  majority of my adult life in a foreign country, I am well

                  network. Though I do have work experience with Mobile Phones,
                  Insurance, Banks, English Language Studies, Business
                  Development and Technology Solutions, I continue to maintain
                  an open mind with all opportunities that may present
                  themselves. I am now looking to utilise my various skills in a
                  new and challenging environment and provide support to my
                  colleagues where possible and grow in areas I lack.
